## Email Verification Compatibility

The compatibility endpoint is preserved:

- `GET /verify/{token}`

This supports existing verification links while enabling agent-first signup flows.

## Legacy AI Agent v6 Endpoints

The following legacy endpoints are removed:

- `POST /api/v6/ai_agent/create`
- `POST /api/v6/ai_agent/get_queued_response`

These calls now return route-not-found API error responses.

## Backward Compatibility Contract

- Existing generation APIs and existing API key auth flow are unchanged.
- New control-plane functionality is additive under `/api/agents/v1`.
- Existing API consumers can continue using current generation endpoints without migration.

## Migration Guidance

1. Use `/api/agents/v1/auth/login` to obtain Bearer token (`token_expiry`: `1_week`, `1_month`, `3_months`, `never`).
2. Use Bearer token for profile, billing, team, and API-key management.
3. Continue using API keys for generation requests under `/api/v6`, `/api/v7`, `/api/v8`.
