## Understanding the Parameters

### Caption: Your Music Blueprint

**Caption is the most important parameter** affecting your generated song. It describes the overall music elements you want.

#### What to Include in Caption

| Dimension | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| **Style/Genre** | pop, rock, jazz, electronic, hip-hop, R&B, folk, reggaeton, synthwave |
| **Emotion/Atmosphere** | melancholic, uplifting, energetic, dreamy, dark, nostalgic, euphoric, intimate |
| **Instruments** | acoustic guitar, piano, synth pads, 808 drums, strings, brass, electric bass |
| **Timbre Texture** | warm, bright, crisp, airy, punchy, lush, raw, polished |
| **Era Reference** | 80s synth-pop, 90s grunge, 2010s EDM, vintage soul, modern trap |
| **Vocal Characteristics** | female vocal, male vocal, breathy, powerful, falsetto, raspy |
| **Production Style** | lo-fi, high-fidelity, live recording, studio-polished |

#### Caption Writing Principles

1. **Be Specific** — "sad piano ballad with female breathy vocal" works better than "a sad song"

2. **Combine Dimensions** — Mix style + emotion + instruments + timbre for precise control

3. **Use References** — "80s synthwave style" or "reggaeton with flamenco influence" conveys complex aesthetics quickly

4. **Texture Words Matter** — Adjectives like warm, crisp, airy, punchy influence mixing and timbre

5. **Balance Detail vs Freedom** — More details = more control, fewer details = more AI creativity

6. **Avoid Conflicts** — Don't combine incompatible styles like "classical strings" and "hardcore metal" unless you want evolution

**Example Good Captions:**

```
A modern reggaeton track with strong flamenco influence, featuring female vocal with reverb,
deep sub-bass, crisp percussion, and plucked synth guitar riff
```

```
Lo-fi hip-hop beat with warm vinyl crackle, mellow piano chords, subtle jazz drums,
and atmospheric pad textures
```

```
80s synthwave pop with bright synth leads, punchy drum machine, nostalgic atmosphere,
and powerful female vocals
```

## Lyrics: Your Song's Timeline

Lyrics control how your song unfolds over time. They include:
- Lyric text content
- Structure tags ([Verse], [Chorus], etc.)
- Vocal style hints
- Instrumental sections
- Energy changes

### Common Structure Tags

| Category | Tag | Description |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| **Basic Structure** | `[Intro]` | Opening, establish atmosphere |
| | `[Verse]` / `[Verse 1]` | Verse, narrative progression |
| | `[Pre-Chorus]` | Build energy before chorus |
| | `[Chorus]` | Emotional climax, hook |
| | `[Bridge]` | Transition or elevation |
| | `[Outro]` | Ending, conclusion |
| **Dynamic Sections** | `[Build]` | Energy gradually rising |
| | `[Drop]` | Electronic music energy release |
| | `[Breakdown]` | Reduced instrumentation |
| **Instrumental** | `[Instrumental]` | Pure instrumental, no vocals |
| | `[Guitar Solo]` | Guitar solo section |
| | `[Piano Interlude]` | Piano interlude |
| **Special Tags** | `[Fade Out]` | Fade out ending |

### Vocal Control Tags

| Tag | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| `[raspy vocal]` | Raspy, textured vocals |
| `[whispered]` | Whispered vocals |
| `[falsetto]` | Falsetto vocals |
| `[powerful belting]` | Powerful, high-pitched singing |
| `[harmonies]` | Layered harmonies |

### Energy Tags

| Tag | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| `[high energy]` | High energy, passionate |
| `[building energy]` | Increasing energy |
| `[explosive]` | Explosive energy |
| `[melancholic]` | Melancholic mood |
| `[euphoric]` | Euphoric feeling |

### Lyrics Writing Tips

**1. Control Syllable Count**

Keep **6-10 syllables per line** for best results. Consistent syllable counts create better rhythm.

**2. Use Case for Intensity**

```
[Verse]
walking through the empty streets (normal)

[Chorus]
WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS! (high intensity)
```

**3. Parentheses for Background Vocals**

```
[Chorus]
We rise together (together)
Into the light (into the light)
```

**4. Clear Section Separation**

Always separate sections with blank lines:

```
[Verse 1]
First verse lyrics here
Continue first verse

[Chorus]
Chorus lyrics here
Chorus continues
```

### Keep Caption and Lyrics Consistent

⚠️ **Critical**: Descriptions in Caption and Lyrics must align. If Caption says "soft piano ballad" but Lyrics has `[explosive metal solo]`, results will be poor.

**Checklist:**
- Instruments in Caption ↔ Instrumental tags in Lyrics
- Emotion in Caption ↔ Energy tags in Lyrics
- Vocal description in Caption ↔ Vocal control tags in Lyrics

---

## Duration Calculation

**You MUST calculate appropriate duration** based on your lyrics and structure.

### Estimation Method

- **Per line of lyrics**: 3-5 seconds
- **Intro/Outro**: 5-10 seconds each
- **Instrumental sections**: 5-15 seconds
- **Typical structures**:
  - 2 verses + 2 choruses: 120-150 seconds minimum
  - 2 verses + 2 choruses + bridge: 180-240 seconds
  - Full song with intro/outro: 210-270 seconds (3.5-4.5 minutes)

### Common Pitfall

❌ **DON'T**: 10 lines of lyrics with 60 seconds duration → rushed and compressed

✅ **DO**: 10 lines → ~40 seconds vocals + 20 seconds intro/outro = 60+ seconds

**Rule**: When in doubt, estimate longer rather than shorter.

---

## Using Lyrics Generation

When you don't have lyrics, set `lyrics_generation: true` and provide:

1. **prompt**: Describe the topic/theme for lyrics
2. **caption**: Describe the music style (same as with manual lyrics)

### Example Request with Lyrics Generation

```json
{
  "key": "your_api_key",
  "lyrics_generation": true,
  "prompt": "A song about overcoming challenges and finding inner strength, with uplifting message and emotional journey from doubt to confidence",
  "caption": "Inspiring pop ballad with piano and strings, building from intimate verse to powerful anthemic chorus, female vocal with emotional delivery",
  "duration": 180,
  "webhook": null,
  "track_id": null
}
```

---

## Instrumental Mode

To generate music without vocals, set `instrumental: true`:

```json
{
  "key": "your_api_key",
  "lyrics_generation": false,
  "lyrics": "[Instrumental]",
  "caption": "Energetic electronic dance music with driving bassline, synth melodies, and dynamic build-ups",
  "instrumental": true,
  "duration": 240,
  "webhook": null,
  "track_id": null
}
```

---

## Language Support

The API supports 50+ languages. Specify the language code:

| Language | Code | Language | Code |
|----------|------|----------|------|
| English | en | Spanish | es |
| Chinese | zh | French | fr |
| Japanese | ja | German | de |
| Korean | ko | Italian | it |
| Portuguese | pt | Russian | ru |
| Hindi | hi | Arabic | ar |
| Cantonese | yue | Turkish | tr |

## Complete Example

### Reggaeton Track with Manual Lyrics

```json
{
  "key": "your_api_key",
  "lyrics_generation": false,
  "lyrics": "[Intro: Sampled Vocal Loop]
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Chorus]
Esta noche todo te lo daré
Es libre ya no me amarraré
Grita mi nombre, dime que me quieres
Me pierdo en tus ojos como si fuera nieve

[Verse 1]
Tus ojos me hipnotizan, me hacen suspirar
Tus labios me llaman, no puedo escapar
Tus manos me tocan, siento la pasión
Cada latido es una explosión

[Chorus]
Esta noche todo te lo daré
Es libre ya no me amarraré
Grita mi nombre, dime que me quieres
Me pierdo en tus ojos como si fuera nieve

[Bridge - whispered]
Solo un instante
Deja que te acerque, ven a mí

[Final Chorus]
Esta noche todo te lo daré
Entre tus brazos me quedaré
Grita mi nombre, dime que me quieres
Me pierdo en tus ojos como si fuera nieve

[Outro]
Solo una noche más",
  "caption": "A modern reggaeton track with strong flamenco influence, opening with pitched vocal sample over dembow beat. Clear confident female vocal in Spanish with reverb. Deep sub-bass, crisp drum machine, plucked synth guitar riff. Layered vocals in chorus, atmospheric bridge, sparse whispered outro.",
  "duration": 199,
  "language": "es",
  "webhook": null,
  "track_id": null
}
```

### Analysis

**Caption matches Lyrics:**
- ✅ Caption says "reggaeton with flamenco" → Lyrics in Spanish with reggaeton structure
- ✅ Caption says "confident female vocal" → Lyrics tone matches
- ✅ Caption mentions "whispered outro" → Lyrics has `[Bridge - whispered]`
- ✅ Duration 199 seconds appropriate for lyrics amount

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Caption First** — Spend time crafting detailed, specific caption
2. **Consistent Description** — Ensure caption and lyrics tell the same story
3. **Calculate Duration** — Count lyrics lines and sections, then estimate time
4. **Use Structure Tags** — Clear sections improve song structure
5. **Test Iterations** — Start simple, then refine based on results
6. **Language Matters** — Set correct language code for best pronunciation

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Too short duration for lyrics | Calculate: lines × 4 seconds + intro/outro |
| Conflicting caption and lyrics | Align instruments, energy, vocal style |
| Vague caption | Add specific genres, instruments, emotions |
| Too many structure tags | Keep tags simple, details in caption |
| No section separation | Add blank lines between sections |
| Mixed incompatible styles | Either separate or describe as evolution |
