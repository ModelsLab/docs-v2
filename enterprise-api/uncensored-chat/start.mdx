```

To continue the next API call, append the object of property `role` and `content` to the **messages** array where the `role` value is **assistant** and the `content` value is the response `message` from the previous call. After that, append another object of same property and pass `role` value as **user** and `content` value as your new description to continue the chat. The request will look like so;
