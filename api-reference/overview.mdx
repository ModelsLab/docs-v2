## Popular integration patterns

### Real-time Applications
Perfect for interactive applications requiring immediate results:
```javascript
// Generate image on-demand
const response = await modelslab.generateImage({
  prompt: "A futuristic cityscape at sunset",
  model: "stable-diffusion-xl",
  style: "photorealistic"
});
```

### Batch Processing
Ideal for processing large volumes of content:
```python
# Process multiple requests efficiently
batch_requests = [
  {"prompt": "Product image 1", "style": "commercial"},
  {"prompt": "Product image 2", "style": "commercial"},
  {"prompt": "Product image 3", "style": "commercial"}
]
results = modelslab.batch_generate(batch_requests)
```

### Webhook Integration
For asynchronous processing of long-running tasks:
```javascript
// Set up webhook for video generation
const videoRequest = await modelslab.generateVideo({
  prompt: "A time-lapse of a flower blooming",
  webhook_url: "https://yourapp.com/webhooks/video-complete"
});
```
