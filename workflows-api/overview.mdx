The Workflows API allows you to execute your custom workflows programmatically. Each workflow you create can be enabled as an API endpoint with its own unique parameters and responses.

## Base URL

```
https://modelslab.com/api/v1/workflows
```

## Authentication

All Workflows API requests require authentication using your ModelsLab API key. Include your API key in the request header:

```
key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

You can find your API key in your [dashboard settings](https://modelslab.com/dashboard/api-keys).

## Rate Limiting

Each workflow has its own configurable rate limit (default: 10 requests per minute per user). When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response with a `retry_after` field indicating when you can retry.

## Webhooks

If your workflow has a webhook URL configured, execution results will be automatically sent to that URL when the workflow completes or fails.

**Webhook Payload:**

```json
{
  "event": "workflow.completed",
  "execution_id": 12345,
  "workflow_id": "uuid-string",
  "status": "completed",
  "output": {
    "output": ["https://cdn.modelslab.com/generated/image1.png"]
  },
  "completed_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:15Z"
}
```
