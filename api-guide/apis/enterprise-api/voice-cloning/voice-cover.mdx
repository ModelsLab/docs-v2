## Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to Overview")

Voice cover endpoint alThe Voice Cover endpoint allows you to transform a song or audio file into a different voice using a provided model. Find all available voice models [HERE](https://modelslab.com/models/category/voice-cloning). lows you to create an audio from an existing audio with a model. Get all voice models [HERE](https://modelslab.com/models/category/voice-cloning) .

<Warning>
  Make sure you add your [s3 details](/enterprise-api/general/update-s3-details) for `voice_cloning` server, so you can receive image generated in your bucket. Images generated without s3 details being added will be delete after **24 hours**
</Warning>
