## Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to Overview")

The Enterprise API is packed with a nice collection of endpoints. Some of them cover the interaction with your server which is the main advantage of the Enterprise plan. Others cover common model, image and video related processes.

Also, there are Image Editing, Voice Cloning and LLM enterprise endpoints suits

<Info>
  The Enterprise API is accessible only with a special **enterprise API key**, which you will receive upon **[purchasing](https://modelslab.com/enterprise#plan)** an enterprise plan.
