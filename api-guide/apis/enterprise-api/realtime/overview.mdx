### Text to Image Endpoint[​](#text-to-image-endpoint "Direct link to Text to Image Endpoint")

This endpoint generates and returns an image from a text passed in the request.

You can write prompt and negative prompt. The prompt is for the things you would like to see in the image and the **negative prompt** is to refine your description by listing the things you do **not want** to have in the generated image.

### Image to Image Endpoint[​](#image-to-image-endpoint "Direct link to Image to Image Endpoint")

This endpoint generates and returns an image from an image passed with its URL in the request.

Together with the image you can add your description of the desired result by passing prompt and negative prompt.

The generated image will be based on the original image with the modifications described in the prompts.

### Inpainting Endpoint[​](#inpainting-endpoint "Direct link to Inpainting Endpoint")

This endpoint generates and returns an image from an image and a mask passed with their URLs in the request.

Together with the image and the mask you can add your description of the desired result by passing prompt and negative prompt.

The generated image will be based on the original image with the applied mask in order to replace an element in the image according to the modifications described in the prompts.

### Fetch Queued Images Endpoint[​](#fetch-queued-images-endpoint "Direct link to Fetch Queued Images Endpoint")

This endpoint returns an already generated image by passing its **ID** with the endpoint location. This ID is specified by the **id** parameter in the response returned upon the request execution.

<Note>
  Sometimes the response to your request might be with a **processing** status. In this case, instead of an output image, you will get its **ID** and the **eta** (estimated time) needed for it to be generated. This is when the Fetch Queued Image endpoint comes in handy. Simply pass your API key as the request body to the endpoint location returned by the `fetch_result` parameter.

  Alternatively, in your generation request, you can pass a webhook, on which a post API call will be made.
